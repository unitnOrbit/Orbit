During the developement of this project, we encountered some problems.
They might be bugs in the ORM itself, or bugs in our code, but they
come and go here are the workarounds:

Error reading annotations
	- restart play

You can not mix enhancement in a single hierarchy
	- stop play
	- comment out "ebean.default..." line in conf/application.conf
        - drop and recreate database
	- start play
        - load a page from your browser (you'll get DataSource user is null)

DataSource user is null (this is actually supposed to happen)
	- stop play
	- uncomment "ebean.default..." line in conf/application.conf
	- start play
