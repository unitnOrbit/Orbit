During the developement of this project, we encountered some problems.
They might be bugs in the ORM itself, or bugs in our code, but they
come and go here are the workarounds:

Error reading annotations
	- restart play

You can not mix enhancement in a single hierarchy
	- stop play
	- drop and create the database (obtain an empty db)
	- comment out "ebean.default..." line in conf/application.conf
	- start play

DataSource is null (this is actually supposed to happen)
	- stop play
	- uncomment "ebean.default..." line in conf/application.conf
	- start play
